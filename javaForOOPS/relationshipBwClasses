In java the classes interact with each other in 3 ways...

1. Association: Here one class is just associated with other class..all these classes are indenpendent. The relation could be one to one, many to 
one, many to many.

2. Aggeration: In this relationship one class; the whole is having parts of other class, the parts; and the exsistence of parts is not dependent on 
the whole class. For ex: books in a library, the books can be kept any where else, if library goes down.

3. Composition: It is strict form of aggreation where if the whole gets destroyed the parts also gets destroyed. For ex: rooms of a house.
